            <p>The tell-tale heart is a story about the narrator's desire to kill an old man because of the
                old man's vulture eye. He really could not stand the old man's eye to the point where he
                made up his mind to kill the old man so that he did not have to see that vulture eye again.
                
                <br /> The narrator calls it an evil eye. Every night he walks into the old man's room and plots
                against the eye. Until on the 8th night, he kills the old man to rid himself of that vulture. 
                As this is happening the old man screams alerting one of the neighbors. By the time the cops arrive,
                the narrator has already dismembered the body and hidden it under the floor boards. 
                <br /> The narrator is confident that he won't get caught. The cops have no suspicion of what has 
                happened and they have no idea that the body is beneath them. As the conversation grew longer with
                the police officers, the narrator hears a sound like a heart beat. He grows anxious and questions 
                if the officers can hear it. He thinks they are mocking him by not noticing it. It grows louder and louder
                until he can't take it no longer and confesses that the old man is right beneath them.
